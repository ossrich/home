## A Focus on Impact

At its heart, this project is about mapping out the different ways we might achieve better outcomes around OSS sustainability and community, and creating a space for those outcomes to happen.

To achieve these impacts, we're using [a tool commonly known as impact mapping](https://www.impactmapping.org) which allows for divergent ideas and a way of thinking about influencing outcomes that we think will be very helpful. We'll use the impact map items to drive a rough outline of priorities for our organization, at which point we'll explore the problem space and then welcome contributions around those items.
